<p>Learn how Datica not only complies with HIPAA, but builds a better, more secure environment to mitigate your risk and help you prove compliance with HIPAA. We did the hard work so you don&rsquo;t have to. And you can inherit a lot of the work that we&rsquo;ve done in terms of audits. Our HIPAA compliant API, platform, and data integration service simplify compliance for you. To learn more about our products or to get setup with an account today, check out our <a href="https://datica.com/compliant-cloud">Compliant Cloud</a> and <a href="https://datica.com/managed-integration">Managed Integration</a>.</p>

<p>In an effort to be transparent, we go into a good amount detail on this page. As a lead in, below is a high level summary our major architecture, our guiding principles, and how it maximizes our security posture.</p>

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th>Need</th>
<th>Datica Approach</th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td>Encryption</td>
<td>All data is encrypted in transit, end to end, and at rest. Log data is also encrypted to mitigate risk of ePHI stored in log files.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Minimum Necessary Access</td>
<td>Access controls are always defaulted to no access unless overrided manually.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>System Access Tracking</td>
<td>All access requests and changes of access, as well as approvals, are tracked and retained.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>PHI Segmentation</td>
<td>All customer data is segmented. Additionally, all platform customers have a dedicated overlay network (subnet) for additional network segmentation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Monitoring</td>
<td>All network requests, successful and unsuccessful, are logged, along with all system logs. API PHI requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) log the requestor, location, and data changed/viewed. Additionally, alerts are proactively sent based on suspicious activity. OSSEC is used for IDS and file integrity monitoring.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Auditing</td>
<td>All log data is encrypted and unified, enabling secure access to full historical network activity records.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Minimum Risk to Architecture</td>
<td>Secure, encrypted access is the only form of public access enabled to servers. All API access must first pass through Datica firewalls. To gain full access to Datica systems, users must login via 2 factor authentication through VPN, authenticate to the specific system as a regular user, and upgrade privileges on the systems temporarily as needed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vulnerability Scanning</td>
<td>All customer and internal networks are scanned regularly for vulnerabilities.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Intrusion Detection</td>
<td>All production systems have intrusion detection software running to proactively detect anomalies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Backup</td>
<td>All customer data is backed up every 24 hours. Seven (7) days of rolling backups are retained.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Disaster Recovery</td>
<td>Datica has an audited and regularly tested disaster recovery plan. This plan also applies to customers, and they inherit this from us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Documentation</td>
<td>All documentation (policies and procedures that make up our security and compliance program) is stored and versioned using GitHub, and published <a href="https://poliyc.datica.com">here</a>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Risk Management</td>
<td>We proactively perform risk assessments to assure changes to our infrastructure do not expose new risks to ePHI. Risks mitigation is done before changes are pushed to production.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Workforce Training</td>
<td>Despite not having access to the ePHI of our customers, all Datica workforce members undergo HIPAA and security training regularly. Current training is hosted <a href="https://training.datica.com/">here</a>.</td>
</tr>

<p>See the finer grain details of how we comply with HIPAA below. These are mapped to specific HIPAA rules. There&rsquo;s a lot here but again, we are taking this responsibility on so that our customers don&rsquo;t have to. Controls marked with an (Req) are <em>Required</em>. Controls marked with an (A) are <em>Addressable</em>. In our environment, controls outlined below are implemented on all infrastructure that processes, stores, transmits or can otherwise gain access to ePHI (electronic protected health information). If have questions, please <a href="mailto:hello@datica.com">email us</a>.</p>

<p>Taken directly from the wording of the Security Rule, administrative safeguards are <em>administrative actions, and policies and procedures, to manage the selection, development, implementation, and maintenance of security measures to protect electronic protected health information and to manage the conduct of the covered entity&rsquo;s workforce in relation to the protection of that information.</em></p>

<p>There aren&rsquo;t specific security settings in this section, and the most important area covered is the risk assessment. The risk assessment is a fundamental process for any organization that wants to become compliant.</p>

<p>Datica Health, Inc. has a risk management policy that defines the risk analysis and risk management process. This policy is operationalized with processes to conduct regularly risk assessments. Datica uses NIST800-30 and 800-26 for performing risk analysis. Our policy begins with an inventory of all Datica systems, mapping of where ePHI is processed, transmitted, or stored, identification of threats, risks, and likelihood, and the mitigation of risks. Policies address risk inherent within the environment and mitigating the risk to an acceptable and reasonable level.</p>

<p>Datica has a Sanction Policy that has sanctions for employees not adhering to certain policies, and for specifically violating HIPAA rules.</p>

<p>Policies and procedures address the requirements of monitoring and logging system level events and actions taken by individuals within the environment. All requests into and out of the Datica network are logged, as well as all system events. Datica, has implemented multiple logging and monitoring solutions to track events within their environment and to monitor for certain types of behavior. Log data is regularly reviewed. Additionally, proactive alerts are enabled and triggered based on certain suspicious activity.</p>

<p>Datica Health, Inc. has policies in place that require workforce members requesting access to ePHI to submit an authorization form that is signed and acknowledges their responsibility of safeguarding ePHI. The form must also be approved by the Security Officer. Once signed and approved, then the individual will be provisioned access to systems deemed business necessary. All Access to ePHI is based on minimum necessary requirements and least privilege. Datica cannot access ePHI unless customers explicitly grant access.</p>

<p>Datica policies define the immediate removal of access once an employee has been terminated, with the Security Officer responsible for terminating the access. Once HR initiates the termination process the termination checklist is referenced to ensure necessary actions are taken to remove systems and facilities access.</p>

<p>Datica has employed a centralized access control system for authenticating and accessing internal systems where ePHI resides. Currently, Datica employees access a bastion host using an SSH-2 connection to access internal systems. Accounts on the internal database are restricted to a limited number of personnel, with logging in place to track all transactions.</p>

<p>All data in transit with Datica is sent over internet connections through an TLS1.1/TLS1.2 encrypted mechanism. Load balancers segment the traffic and send transmissions of the data to the application servers via an encrypted connection using the TLS protocol. Additionally, none of the internal application servers, database servers, and log and monitoring servers are accessible via public internet. All internal servers must be accessed via bastion host which are not accessible from the internet and require an SSH connection.</p>

<p>These requirements simply outline the need for business associate agreements (BAAs) between covered entities and business associates. This requirement has recently been extended to require business associate agreements between business associates and all subcontractors. That linking, chaining together of of BAAs, has created for new and interesting legal and business questions. Basically, each layer in the chain of BAAs takes on certain responsibilities and certain risks as part of HIPAA, and there needs to be consistency. Case in point, at Datica we have several customers that have moved over from compliant IaaS providers because those providers had breach notification timelines that were not acceptable for large healthcare enterprises. We&rsquo;ve taken a proactive approach to BAAs to mitigate risk for our customers and assure consistency along the chain of BAAs.</p>
