<p>This one is pretty straight forward - <em>physical measures, policies, and procedures to protect a covered entityâ€™s electronic information systems and related buildings and equipment, from natural and environmental hazards, and unauthorized intrusion.</em> Data center security is typically easier to address than office security, though at Datica we address both.</p>

</tbody></table>

<p>Datica Health, Inc. has policies in place that define the acceptable uses in place for workstations within the environment. These policies define the acceptable and unauthorized uses of personnel that provided workstations with access to systems potentially interacting with ePHI. These policies are enforced on all workstations. All internal email uses HIPAA-compliant vendors.</p>

<p>Datica has a formal Workstation and Portable Media Security Policy that identifies the specific requirements of each device. The policies define the requirements for using and/or restricted specific actions while engaged with any ePHI. Additionally, workstations are secured appropriately to limit exposure to breaches. Firewalls and hard disk encryption are used on all workstations. Actions and events are monitored and controlled, with user restrictions on downloading or copying any ePHI without documented approval and business justification. Additionally, all file storage internally at Datica utilizes HIPAA-compliant cloud-based vendors (currently Box and Google Apps).</p>

</tbody></table>

<p>Datica has policies and procedures for all workstations that interact with and may potentially become exposed to ePHI. These policies have requirements for secure media disposal so that ePHI cannot be recovered from these systems.</p>

<p>Datica has Media re-use requirements for the workstations, despite the fact that these workstations do not have access to and interaction with ePHI.</p>

<h2 id="technical-safeguards-(see-164.312)">Technical Safeguards (see <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/administrative/securityrule/techsafeguards.pdf">164.312</a>)</h2>

<p>This section of HIPAA outlines <em>the technology and the policy and procedures for its use that protect electronic protected health information and control access to it.</em> It is important to note that these requirements are not prescriptive, and there is flexibility in implementation. The key is that measures that are reasonable and appropriate are implemented to safeguard ePHI.</p>

<p>Datica Health, Inc. has policies in place addressing audit trail requirements. Systems within the its environment are logging to a centralized logging solution, Logstash, which is monitoring system level events and contains user id, timestamp, event, origination, and type of event. These logs are constantly monitored for suspicious events and alerts are generated to any type of behavior that is suspicious.</p>

</tbody></table>

<p>All data in transit with Datica is sent over internet connections through an TLS1.1/TLS1.2 encrypted mechanism. Load balancers segment the traffic and send transmissions of the data to the application servers via an encrypted connection using the TLS protocol. Additionally, none of the internal application servers, database servers, and log and monitoring servers are accessible via public internet. All internal servers must be accessed via bastion host which are not accessible from the internet and require an SSH connection.</p>
